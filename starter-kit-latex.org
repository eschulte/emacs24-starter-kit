** Prerequesites

In order to use AUCTeX the following software is required in addition:

*** A working TeX installation

**** UNIX-Style systems
A popular TEX system is TEX Live which may also be available via the
package system of your operating system distribution.

**** Mac OSX
A popular TEX system for Mac OS X is MacTEX which is based on TEX
Live.

mode. Most versions of Ghostscript nowadays in use should work fine
(version 7.0 and newer).
