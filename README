This is a Literate Programming fork of the original Emacs Starter Kit

This should provide a saner set of defaults than you get normally with
Emacs. It's intended for beginners, but provides a good elisp
initialization structure for all levels of users.

The main advantages of this Emacs Starter Kit are
- better default settings
- easy loading of many useful libraries and configurations
- "literate" customization embedded in Org-mode files
- an organizational directory structure
- git provides for version control, backup, and sharing
- easy installation with no need to compile external packages
